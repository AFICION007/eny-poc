This research paper digs deeper into the investigation of the deal's background and strategic rationale, analytical studies, and financial structuring, with a deeper dig into the significant roles played by business analytics and investment banking to make the deal a reality. Acquiring Blinkit proved a well-thought-out shift for Zomato, for it could align itself with emerging consumer and market trends, and face competition from other players in the market, such as Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto.\n\nFrom evaluating Blinkit’s customer data, all the way to forecasting profitability and operational & integrational synergies, Business analytics played an extensive role. Various aspects of Blinkit’s business, such as consumer behaviour, delivery efficiency, and potential for growth in the quick commerce sector, were studied using data-driven models. At the time of acquisition, Blinkit faced mounting losses; hence, predictive analytics and key performance indicators were vital in risk assessment.",

The company’s share price rose 2% to Rs 234.10, boosting its market capitalization to nearly $25 billion. Key contributors to the growth include its quick-commerce vertical Blinkit and B2B grocery supply unit Hyperpure. Blinkit plans to expand its dark store network to 2,000 by 2026, up from 639 as of June 30, despite rising competition from rivals like Zepto. Blinkit recorded a gross order value (GOV) of Rs 4,923 crore, up 130% year-on-year, driven by increased consumption and a shift from traditional ecommerce.  \n\nZomato’s food delivery business grew 27% year-on-year in GOV to Rs 9,264 crore, though profitability dipped slightly due to seasonality. Despite challenges like inflation and sluggish demand affecting quick-service restaurants, Zomato’s CFO Akshant Goyal noted steady growth in food delivery.  \n\nThe company is also expanding into the “going-out” segment with a new standalone app, District, which will cater to dining, events, ticketing, and more. Zomato’s CEO Deepinder Goyal highlighted plans to create a one-stop destination for activities like movies, sports, shopping, and staycations. The going-out business reported a GOV of Rs 1,268 crore for the quarter, up 106% year-on-year. Zomato is reportedly in talks to acquire Paytm’s movie ticketing and events division to strengthen this segment.  \n\nWith its diversified focus on food delivery, quick commerce, and entertainment, Zomato aims to capture consumer demand across multiple categories, positioning itself as a leader in India’s evolving digital economy.",

                "description": "Zomato’s acquisition of Blinkit in June 2022, valued at $568 million, marked a strategic entry into India’s fast-growing quick-commerce (q-commerce) market. This move aimed to diversify Zomato’s portfolio, leveraging synergies between its food delivery and hyperlocal delivery services. Quick commerce, characterized by 10-20 minute deliveries of groceries and essentials, has seen exponential growth, and Zomato sought to capitalize on this trend by integrating Blinkit’s inventory-led model with its extensive delivery network.  \n\nThe acquisition aligns with Zomato’s strategy to enhance customer retention by offering a one-stop solution for food and grocery needs, increasing engagement and loyalty. It also broadens Zomato’s addressable market, targeting urban and semi-urban consumers, while future-proofing its business model against the cyclical nature of food delivery. Additionally, Blinkit’s technology and data analytics capabilities enable Zomato to optimize operations, personalize recommendations, and boost order values.  \n\nFrom a management perspective, the deal reflects the Resource-Based View (RBV), as Zomato utilized its core competencies to unlock new revenue streams, and Porter’s Five Forces, addressing threats like competition from Swiggy, Zepto, and BigBasket. Blinkit’s supplier relationships also strengthen Zomato’s procurement capabilities.  \n\nHowever, the acquisition posed financial challenges, with Blinkit reporting a ₹2,181 crore loss in FY22, raising investor concerns. Despite this, Zomato’s management remains optimistic, citing improved unit economics, increased order volumes, and better fleet utilization as signs of long-term potential. While Blinkit has contributed to revenue growth, its profitability remains a work in progress.  \n\nIn conclusion, Zomato’s acquisition of Blinkit represents a calculated risk to secure a foothold in the q-commerce market, with the potential for significant long-term rewards despite short-term financial hurdles.",

Both companies have revolutionized the food-tech industry by offering services like food delivery, grocery delivery, and restaurant discovery. Their IPOs have attracted significant investor interest, reflecting the sector's growth potential.  \n\nSwiggy, founded in 2014, operates in over 500 cities and has diversified into grocery delivery (Instamart) and cloud kitchens (Swiggy Access). Its IPO debut exceeded expectations, with strong market performance driven by its focus on quick-commerce and expansion into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Swiggy’s valuation stands at $10.7 billion, and it has achieved EBITDA breakeven, signaling progress toward profitability.  \n\nZomato, established in 2008, transitioned from a restaurant review platform to a food delivery giant with operations in 24+ countries. Its acquisition of Blinkit has bolstered its quick-commerce presence. Zomato’s IPO in 2021 was a success, with its market cap doubling since listing. The company benefits from strong brand recognition, global presence, and strategic acquisitions, though it remains in the early stages of profitability.  \n\nThe Indian food-tech market has consolidated into a duopoly, with Swiggy and Zomato leading the space. Zomato holds a larger market share, particularly in Tier 1 cities, while Swiggy focuses on underserved markets and diverse offerings. Both companies face intense competition but are well-positioned for growth through scaling operations and diversifying revenue streams.  \n\nInvestors must weigh factors like profitability, execution, and market positioning.

Zomato focuses on high-margin services like restaurant advertising, cloud kitchens, and its subscription program, Zomato Pro, while Swiggy emphasizes diversification with offerings like grocery delivery (Instamart) and local errands (Swiggy Genie).  \n\nZomato has seen significant growth in market share, rising from 38.8% in 2018 to 58% in 2023, driven by strategic initiatives and international expansion. Swiggy, once the market leader with a 61.2% share in 2018, has seen its share decline to 34% in 2023, partly due to its focus on quick commerce. Financially, Zomato outperformed Swiggy in FY24, achieving revenue growth of 71.1% and turning profitable with Rs 3.51 bn in net profit, while Swiggy narrowed its losses but remained unprofitable.  \n\nOperationally, Zomato leads in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs), and restaurant partnerships, while Swiggy excels in customer acquisition efficiency. Zomato's focus on extracting more value per user contrasts with Swiggy's cost-effective growth strategy.  \n\nBoth companies face challenges in profitability and competition from emerging players, but their resilience and adaptability position them well for future growth. For investors, Zomato's clear path to profitability and strong market presence make it a more compelling choice for long-term investment, while Swiggy's diversified offerings highlight its potential for expansion.  \n\nAs the food delivery market evolves, driven by changing consumer habits and technological advancements, Zomato and Swiggy remain key players shaping the industry's future.",

For instance, dark stores in high-density areas (15,000+ people per square km) are essential for profitability. Partnerships with cloud kitchens and food aggregators are also driving innovations in ultra-fast food delivery.  \n\nThe Q-Commerce race in SEA is not about being the first mover but about scaling quickly with smart economics. Investors have a unique opportunity to back category creators, while operators can draw lessons from India and MENA to build habit-forming use cases and close last-mile trust gaps.  \n\nWith SEA’s digitally native population and growing demand for convenience, Q-Commerce is set to disrupt traditional retail and eCommerce, creating significant opportunities for businesses that act swiftly and strategically.",

Similarly, quick commerce (Q-commerce) in the UAE is evolving into a multi-vertical ecosystem, expanding beyond food delivery to meet diverse consumer needs.  \n\nGlobally, food delivery platforms are capitalizing on peak demand days like IPL matches and festive seasons to gain new users and boost sales. In Indonesia, local cuisines and offline channels are gaining prominence, while Saudi Arabia’s food aggregators are creating jobs and redefining convenience.

The QC market, currently valued at $12.6 billion, is projected to grow to $47.7 billion by 2029. Blinkit leads with a 41% market share, followed by Zepto (27%) and Instamart (20%).  \n\nAmazon's entry has triggered concerns among analysts, with Zomato and Swiggy's stock prices declining by up to 2%. While Amazon offers attractive pricing, especially for Prime users, analysts believe its late entry and lack of QC-specific brand recall pose challenges. Building logistics infrastructure, such as dark stores and warehouses, and launching a dedicated QC app are seen as critical for Amazon's success.  \n\nDespite Amazon's arrival, analysts expect Zomato and Swiggy to maintain their competitive edge due to their deep local expertise and ecosystem integration. However, margin pressures may rise as discount-driven customer acquisition intensifies. QC platforms are increasingly focusing on profitability by reducing discounts on low-value items, introducing various fees, and raising minimum order values for free deliveries.  \n\nBrokerages like JM Financial suggest that EBITDA losses for Blinkit and Instamart may have peaked in 4QFY25, signaling potential profitability improvements. Analysts remain optimistic about Zomato and Swiggy's medium-term growth, assigning 'BUY' ratings to both companies. While Amazon's entry raises the stakes, sustained efficiency and service differentiation will determine long-term success in the QC market.",

Analysts said the company has shown good recovery across important operational parameters in March 2021.\n\nICICI Securities Ltd’s analysts said in a report on 8 July, “The robust increase in signed up restaurants on delivery / discovery platforms (about 16000/40000) is the most interesting update – given it comes amidst negative news flow about ‘perceived’ dissatisfaction of ‘some’ restaurants with Zomato.” The broker added, “End–March 2021, restaurant count on delivery platform was about 5000 more than even the pre-covid peak.”\n\nFurther, Zomato’s average order value, or AOV, for the March quarter stood at around Rs395 versus Rs287 seen in the same period last year. The measure was pretty much stable though compared to the December quarter, when AOV was almost Rs408 crore. AOV is a function of the number of people the food is being ordered for and the price of food at restaurants.\n\nZomato’s GOV in the March 2021 quarter stood at Rs3,310 crore. GOV is short for gross order value and represents total monetary value of orders including taxes, customer delivery charges, gross of all discounts, excluding tips. “As lockdowns eased in India towards the end of May 2020, our food delivery business started recovering and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we recorded the highest GOV achieved by us in a quarter in India till March 2021,” highlights the RHP.\n\nICICI Securities’ analysts said, “GOV retention in older cohorts (FY17 & FY18) was reasonably strong despite covid impact in FY21.” They added, “Expectedly, retention in newer cohorts (FY19 & FY20) saw a bigger drop. In our view, these cohorts are largely outside the urban core where food services faced more serious logistical constraints (versus Top-20) due to lockdowns.”\n\nTo be sure, Zomato’s unit economics were impacted in the March quarter due to higher discounts and delivery charges. Note that gross contribution per order in the March quarter stood at Rs16, lower than Rs23 seen in the nine-month period ended December 2020. This measure for FY20 stands at a negative Rs31.",

                "description": "Zomato posted a Rs 253 crore net profit for the April-June quarter, a significant jump from Rs 2 crore a year ago, driven by a 74% rise in operating revenue to Rs 4,206 crore. The performance exceeded analyst expectations, boosting its share price and market capitalization to nearly $25 billion. Key growth drivers included its quick-commerce vertical Blinkit and B2B grocery unit Hyperpure. Blinkit plans to expand its dark store network to 2,000 by 2026, up from 639 as of June 30, despite rising competition from rivals like Zepto. Blinkit’s gross order value (GOV) surged 130% year-on-year to Rs 4,923 crore, fueled by increased consumption and a shift from traditional ecommerce.\n\nZomato’s food delivery business grew 27% year-on-year in GOV to Rs 9,264 crore, though profitability dipped slightly due to seasonality. Despite challenges like inflation and sluggish demand affecting quick-service restaurants, Zomato’s CFO Akshant Goyal noted steady growth in food delivery. The company is also diversifying into entertainment and events with its upcoming standalone app, District, aimed at capturing the \"going-out\" market. This app will integrate dining, movies, sports ticketing, live performances, and more, potentially becoming a major B2C business for Zomato.\n\nThe going-out segment reported a GOV of Rs 1,268 crore for the quarter, up 106% year-on-year. Zomato is also exploring acquisitions, including Paytm’s movie ticketing division, to strengthen its offerings. CEO Deepinder Goyal emphasized the strategic importance of building a one-stop destination app for entertainment and outings, positioning Zomato as a multi-category consumer platform.",

                "description": "Zomato reported a consolidated loss of INR 250.8 Cr in Q2 FY23, marking a 35% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) increase. Despite this, revenue from operations grew 17% QoQ to INR 1,661.3 Cr. Expenses surged 60.4% YoY to INR 2,561.4 Cr, with delivery-related charges accounting for INR 590.3 Cr.  \n\nThe food delivery segment remained the company’s strongest performer, contributing INR 1,135.7 Cr in revenue, a 33% YoY increase. Gross order value rose to INR 6,600 Cr, with 248 cities generating 91% of the total. Adjusted EBITDA for food delivery improved to INR 2 Cr, compared to a loss of INR 113 Cr in the previous quarter.  \n\nZomato’s B2B supplies business, Hyperpure, saw significant growth, with revenue rising to INR 334.1 Cr, up from INR 116.1 Cr YoY. However, its adjusted EBITDA loss worsened to INR 53 Cr. Meanwhile, the ‘Others’ segment, including dining-out services, faced declining revenues due to discontinued monetization efforts. Zomato plans to revamp this vertical, piloting new features in 12 cities.  \n\nBlinkit, Zomato’s quick commerce subsidiary, reported a revenue of INR 236 Cr, up 43% QoQ. Its adjusted EBITDA loss reduced to INR 259 Cr, but the entity’s performance continued to weigh on Zomato’s overall financials. Blinkit’s order volume grew 17% QoQ to 26.1 Mn, with average order value rising 8% to INR 568.  \n\nZomato’s claims of achieving break-even were revised after reallocating unallocated costs to the food delivery segment. CEO Deepinder Goyal expressed optimism about faster growth in food delivery, despite ongoing challenges in profitability.",
