This partnership presents a special chance for up-and-coming firms to quickly expand and reach Instamart's sizable and expanding consumer base in 70 cities.\n\nThe \"Shark Tank\" section will spotlight 100+ emerging brands from season 4, along with more than 100 products from earlier seasons, many of which are fan-favourites on the platform. From categories like health, food, beverages, beauty, fashion, gaming and more, consumers will now have easy access to a wide range of trending products they discover on the show.\n\nSwiggy Instamart has given more than 250 D2C brands a platform throughout the years, bringing together distinctive products that appeal to customers based on factors like price, ingredients, or meeting particular needs. The platform, which has millions of monthly users and is present in more than 70 cities, has developed into a perfect channel for new firms looking to reach consumers nationwide.\n\nSince being added to Swiggy Instamart in 2024, brands like The Select Aisle, Bold Care, Beardo, and Anveshan have seen an increase in orders of over 100%, reaching their highest-ever totals on occasions like New Year's Eve. D2C and FMCG brands will be among the many sectors represented in the Shark Tank segment. Go Zero, Beast Life, Patch Up, MetaShot, and Fae Beauty are a few well-known brands.\n\nAmitesh Jha, CEO of Swiggy Instamart, commented, “Shark Tank India celebrates entrepreneurship and innovation—values that are deeply aligned with our mission to provide unparalleled convenience to our users.

Early on, asset-lite models, backed by investors like Tiger Global and Softbank, failed due to their inability to meet customer expectations of reliability and convenience. Bigbasket emerged as a leader with its inventory-led model and slotted next-day delivery, while Grofers pivoted from asset-lite to inventory-led. However, next-day delivery proved inadequate for impulsive, top-up purchases, leading Bigbasket to experiment with express (60-minute) delivery, which was later abandoned due to strategic flaws.  \n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the market, with Swiggy's Instamart introducing 30-45 minute delivery and startups like Blinkit and Zepto pioneering the audacious 10-minute delivery model. Customers overwhelmingly preferred the speed and convenience of the 10-minute model, which addressed 95% of their grocery needs with a curated assortment of 15,000 items. This model quickly outpaced Bigbasket's 5-7 hour delivery, forcing the company to adapt.  \n\nBigbasket eventually embraced the 10-minute model while retaining its 5-7 hour \"super-saver\" option. However, the rapid customer shift toward ultra-fast delivery made it clear that the 10-minute model was the future. Despite being a late entrant, Bigbasket's strong execution capabilities position it to compete effectively in this space.  \n\nThe online grocery landscape has now converged on the 10-minute delivery model as the ultimate solution, offering unparalleled convenience and speed. Customers, meanwhile, are enjoying the benefits of intense competition among players.",

This model, valued at $3.34 billion in India in 2024, is projected to grow to $9.95 billion by 2029, driven by urbanization, changing lifestyles, and technological advancements.  \n\nUnlike traditional e-commerce, which focuses on bulk orders and longer delivery times, q-commerce thrives on hyperlocal logistics, dark stores, and AI-driven inventory management. Key players like Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart, and BigBasket (BB Now) have redefined convenience, catering to the \"I-need-it-now\" mentality of urban consumers. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated its adoption, with lockdowns highlighting the need for instant access to essentials.  \n\nQ-commerce has also impacted traditional retail and e-commerce. While it has reduced foot traffic to kirana stores, many have partnered with q-commerce platforms to digitize operations. Traditional e-commerce giants like Flipkart and Amazon are adapting by introducing same-day delivery services.  \n\nDespite its advantages—convenience, economic growth, and tech-driven innovation—q-commerce faces challenges like high operational costs, delivery personnel safety concerns, and environmental impact. Critics also highlight its role in encouraging impulsive buying and marginalizing small retailers.  \n\nThe future of q-commerce lies in expanding to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, integrating sustainable practices, and diversifying product offerings. With projections of a $40 billion market in India by 2030, q-commerce is set to remain a key player in shaping modern retail.

In one global survey of chief executive officers, 77% said they would pursue operational efficiencies to drive total revenue growth.1\n\nThere are a variety of software tools and platforms—powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT)—available to help companies achieve operational efficiency.

In financial markets, it refers to reducing transaction costs and fees, enabling participants to execute trades at fair prices. Greater operational efficiency leads to higher profitability, whether in business production or investment markets. Economies of scale often improve efficiency, such as buying more shares at fixed trading costs to lower fees per share.\n\nIn investment markets, operational efficiency enhances portfolio performance by minimizing frictional costs. Metrics like a fund’s expense ratio—comprising transaction costs, management fees, and administrative expenses—help assess efficiency. Passive funds, with lower expense ratios, are generally more operationally efficient than active funds due to index replication and economies of scale.\n\nRegulatory changes also influence operational efficiency. For example, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) allowed money market funds to meet margin requirements in 2000, reducing trading costs. Similarly, an 8.5% cap on mutual fund sales charges protects investors from excessive fees, improving market efficiency.\n\nOperational efficiency differs from productivity, which measures output per time unit. Efficiency focuses on minimizing costs per unit of production or transaction. Both concepts benefit from economies of scale, optimizing production or trading levels to lower costs and increase returns.\n\nIn summary, operational efficiency is crucial for maximizing profitability in both business and investment markets. It is driven by economies of scale, competition, and regulatory measures that reduce costs and enhance fairness for participants.",

This presentation offers a deep dive into how psychological principles can inform smarter, more intuitive product decisions. It’s not just theory — it’s a hands-on blueprint for applying human-centered thinking at every stage of product development. Grounded in behavioral science, consumer psychology, and cognitive design, this deck unpacks the key psychological drivers behind user motivation, decision-making, emotional engagement, and habit formation. From attention economics and dopamine-driven interactions to trust cues, loss aversion, and the paradox of choice — you'll see how to harness what the mind naturally does to build digital products people don’t just use… they return to, talk about, and even advocate for. We’ll explore: Cognitive biases that shape user perception and choices — and how to use them to your advantage without crossing ethical lines. Emotional design principles that build trust, trigger desire, and turn features into feelings. User behavior loops that build stickiness, deepen retention, and create emotional investments. Psychological friction — when to reduce it for conversion, and when to add it for intentionality. Dark patterns vs. ethical persuasion — the thin line between influence and manipulation. A/B testing with a psychological lens — learning not just what works, but why it works. This is more than UX research or product marketing fluff. It’s a call to build with empathy, backed by science, and sharpened by real-world product thinking.

                "description": "Consumer behavior examines how individuals and groups make decisions to purchase, use, and dispose of goods and services. It integrates insights from psychology, biology, economics, and social sciences to understand the motivations, influences, and processes behind consumer choices. Businesses use this knowledge to craft effective marketing strategies, develop products, and build customer loyalty.  \n\nKey factors influencing consumer behavior include marketing campaigns, economic conditions, personal preferences, group influence, and purchasing power. These elements shape how consumers interact with brands and make decisions. Additionally, consumer behavior can be categorized into four types: complex purchasing behavior (high involvement, extensive research), dissonance-reducing behavior (uncertainty between similar options), habitual purchasing behavior (low involvement, routine purchases), and variety-seeking behavior (desire for novelty).  \n\nTo tailor marketing strategies effectively, businesses must align their messaging with the specific behavior type. For example, detailed product information and testimonials work well for complex purchasing behavior, while loyalty programs and consistent branding appeal to habitual buyers.  \n\nStudying consumer behavior involves market research, data analysis, customer segmentation, and monitoring trends. Behavioral segmentation methods, such as RFM analysis, help businesses identify loyal customers, optimize marketing efforts, and improve customer experiences.  \n\nA case study with AliveCor demonstrated the impact of consumer behavior insights. By addressing information gaps and simplifying navigation, AliveCor increased conversion rates by 21% and revenue per visitor by 5%. This highlights the importance of understanding consumer preferences and pain points to drive business growth.  \n\nUltimately, businesses that prioritize consumer behavior analysis can anticipate trends, adapt strategies, and foster meaningful customer relationships, ensuring long-term success in competitive markets.",

The goal is to establish a distinct image or identity in the minds of consumers. For instance, a handbag brand may position itself as a luxury symbol, while a fast-food chain may focus on affordability.  \n\nPositioning strategies include:  \n- **Product attributes and benefits**: Highlighting specific features or value.  \n- **Price**: Associating with competitive or premium pricing.  \n- **Quality**: Emphasizing superior quality.  \n- **Use and application**: Targeting specific uses.  \n- **Competitors**: Differentiating from rivals.  \n\nA perceptual map is a tool used to visualize consumer perceptions of brands, helping identify market opportunities and competitive positioning.  \n\nTo create an effective positioning strategy:  \n1. Develop a clear positioning statement (e.g., Volvo’s focus on safety for families).  \n2. Assess your company’s uniqueness compared to competitors.  \n3. Analyze your current market position and competitors’ influence.  \n4. Formulate a strategy based on market conditions and opportunities.  \n\nMarket repositioning involves altering a brand’s status in response to declining performance or environmental changes. This can be costly and challenging, so some companies opt to launch new products instead.  \n\nAn example of successful repositioning is Coca-Cola’s Mother Energy Drinks in Australia. After a poor initial reception due to taste, Coca-Cola revamped the product by improving its flavor, redesigning packaging, and relaunching with a new campaign. This repositioning allowed Mother to compete with leading brands like Red Bull and V.  \n\nFor further learning, explore CFI’s free corporate finance resources.",

                "description": "Consumer behavior is crucial for businesses aiming to meet consumer needs, adapt to market trends, and ensure stable growth. It involves understanding psychological, personal, social, and cultural factors that influence buying decisions. Marketers rely on data, surveys, and reports to analyze consumer behavior and align strategies accordingly.  \n\nConsumer behavior encompasses psychological studies of needs, buyer behavior, and decision-making processes. Factors like social media, prior experiences, and personality traits also play a role. For instance, perceptions about gender and age can influence vehicle choices. Marketers must understand these dynamics as 76% of consumers expect companies to cater to their needs, and customer-centric organizations outperform others on the S&P 500 Index.  \n\nBuying behavior patterns include complex purchases (e.g., luxury cars), habitual purchases (e.g., tea), variety-seeking behavior (e.g., trying different flavors), and dissonance-reducing behavior (e.g., sticking to familiar brands). The purchase decision process involves problem recognition, search, evaluation, purchase, and post-purchase evaluation.  \n\nCustomer loyalty stems from meeting consumer expectations, leading to repeat purchases, higher conversion rates, and increased profits. The internet significantly impacts consumer behavior by influencing decision-making, providing safety in online purchases, and leveraging social media algorithms to target consumers effectively.  \n\nMarketers use consumer behavior insights to shape advertising, create engaging content, and adjust product lines. Sustainability, aesthetic packaging, wellness-focused messaging, and community-building are strategies to appeal to modern consumers. Brands like Nespresso, Apple, and Gymshark exemplify these approaches.  \n\nUltimately, understanding consumer behavior helps marketers reinforce positive beliefs, shape habits, and align messages with consumer mindsets. By studying buying patterns, businesses can enhance customer retention, acquisition, and overall growth in the competitive digital landscape.",

                "description": "Positioning is the strategic process of shaping how a target market perceives a brand, product, or service relative to competitors. It focuses on creating a distinct space in the customer’s mind, emphasizing unique attributes such as affordability, performance, or alignment with lifestyle. Effective positioning is tied to a brand’s strategic goals and is often visualized through perceptual mapping, which displays customer perceptions of products along key dimensions (e.g., affordability vs. classiness). This helps identify market gaps or areas for differentiation.  \n\nPositioning can be functional (solving problems), symbolic (enhancing self-image), or experiential (providing sensory or cognitive stimulation). A strong positioning strategy allows a product to appeal to diverse customers for different reasons. For instance, a car may attract one buyer for its reliability (functional) and another for its style (symbolic/experiential).  \n\nThe positioning statement is the culmination of this process, succinctly defining the target market, product category, differentiation points, and reasons to believe. A well-crafted statement is simple, memorable, tailored to the target audience, and provides clear direction for marketing efforts. Examples include Amazon’s early focus on convenience and selection for book lovers and Motel 6’s appeal to frugal travelers seeking affordable comfort.  \n\nRepositioning becomes necessary when market conditions, customer preferences, or competitive landscapes change. It involves redefining a product’s identity to better align with market needs. The American Red Cross successfully repositioned itself during the 2009 recession, shifting its focus to holiday giving with the tagline “Give the gift that saves the day.” This campaign reinforced its disaster-relief role while appealing to seasonal generosity, resulting in significant increases in donations and brand awareness.  \n\nPositioning and repositioning are critical tools for maintaining relevance, differentiation, and competitive advantage in dynamic markets.",

Popularized by consulting firm Kearney, the process typically involves seven steps: analyzing product categories and spending patterns, developing a sourcing strategy aligned with business goals, assessing supplier markets, defining RFP criteria, negotiating and finalizing supplier lists, onboarding new suppliers, and optimizing workflows through performance tracking.  \n\nThe benefits of strategic sourcing are extensive. It transforms procurement into a value-driven process, enhances productivity by automating routine tasks, and leverages data analytics for better decision-making. Businesses achieve cost savings by identifying optimal suppliers and negotiating effectively. Strategic sourcing also improves risk management by providing visibility into supplier markets and potential risks. It fosters flexibility, strengthens supplier relationships, streamlines supply chains, and enhances demand forecasting accuracy.  \n\nExamples of strategic sourcing include sourcing goods from accessible locations to manage logistics, using suppliers with strong brand images for competitive differentiation, ensuring compliance through certified components, supporting sustainability with fair trade goods, mitigating geopolitical risks by diversifying suppliers, and minimizing risks through alternative supplier strategies.  \n\nStrategic sourcing differs from procurement in scope and focus. Procurement involves day-to-day activities like purchase orders and invoicing, often emphasizing cost reduction. Strategic sourcing, on the other hand, focuses on pre-purchase activities, analyzing business needs and market conditions to optimize vendor relationships and reduce risks. While procurement seeks the lowest price, strategic sourcing evaluates broader factors to maximize long-term value.

Unlike traditional sourcing, which prioritizes the lowest price, strategic sourcing focuses on the total cost of ownership, emphasizing quality, supplier compatibility, and overall value. It involves continuous market analysis, goal alignment, and re-evaluation of sourcing activities, making it a dynamic, long-term process.  \n\nThe key difference between strategic and traditional sourcing lies in their focus. Traditional sourcing emphasizes cost reduction through bulk buying and high volumes, while strategic sourcing evaluates all operational costs and prioritizes supplier relationships that align with company objectives. Strategic sourcing operates globally, leveraging in-depth market reviews and supplier agreements to maximize operational impact.  \n\nThe importance of strategic sourcing lies in its ability to reduce overall costs over time by selecting suppliers based on compatibility with company goals rather than short-term price advantages. This is achieved through digitization, data analysis, and market monitoring, which help identify the right suppliers to enhance profitability.  \n\nThe strategic sourcing process typically involves seven stages:  \n1. Analyze internal processes, product categories, and spending patterns.  \n2. Assess the supply market and create a supplier portfolio, considering risks and opportunities.  \n3. Form a cross-functional team to determine the sourcing approach.  \n4. Research potential suppliers and request proposals based on specifications.  \n5. Review and compare proposals, conducting multiple negotiation rounds if necessary.  \n6. Select and integrate the right supplier, ensuring open communication and effective onboarding.  \n7.

By breaking down sales growth into price, volume, and mix components, FP&A leaders can provide actionable insights to improve business performance.  \n\nA small electronics company demonstrated the value of PVM analysis when explaining a 20.1% YoY revenue increase despite a 12.5% decline in Smart Phone sales. The VP FP&A used a three-step PVM calculation process: (1) Price impact, (2) Volume impact, and (3) Mix impact. This analysis revealed that price changes contributed 3.5% of the growth, volume changes accounted for 10.4%, and sales mix shifts added 6.3%.  \n\nFrom a product perspective, Computers drove $105M in revenue growth due to favorable price, volume, and mix dynamics, while Tablets added $12M by leveraging price elasticity. Smart Phones, however, dragged revenue by $30M due to a failed price increase strategy. These insights enabled management to identify areas for improvement, such as revisiting marketing assumptions for Smart Phones and optimizing the sales mix for Computers.  \n\nPVM analysis can be applied beyond product categories, including customers, sales channels, and regions. It can also be extended to Gross Margin analysis by combining revenue and COGS PVM calculations. Best practices include performing PVM at the SKU level, ensuring consistent units of measure, and filtering out skewed data like new or discontinued products.  \n\nFTI Consulting’s Office of the CFO Solutions practice offers expertise in applying PVM analysis to drive revenue growth and cost optimization.

By analyzing individual Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), companies can identify top-selling products, slow-moving items, and underperforming SKUs, allowing for strategic decisions on inventory, marketing, and resource allocation.  \n\nBenefits of SKU analysis include managing SKU proliferation, monitoring product performance across channels, conducting clearer cost analyses, and improving ROI through better investment decisions. SKU rationalization helps businesses determine whether to continue stocking or discontinue certain SKUs based on metrics like holding costs, fulfillment fees, and historical sales data. This process prevents losses from slow-moving products and frees up resources for high-performing items.  \n\nSKU proliferation, while a natural part of business growth, can lead to inefficiencies if unchecked. Analyzing proliferation efforts ensures that new products or variations contribute to profitability rather than cluttering storage and increasing costs. Inventory management software can streamline SKU analysis by tracking key metrics like historical sales and warehousing costs, enabling accurate profitability assessments and demand predictions.  \n\nThe 80/20 rule highlights that 20% of SKUs often account for 80% of sales, while the remaining 80% may hinder growth. SKU analysis helps businesses identify and address these disparities, improving operational efficiency and financial outcomes.  \n\nBy leveraging SKU-level insights, companies can make informed investment decisions, eliminate underperforming products, and focus on bestsellers.

It breaks down revenue variance into three key components: price, volume, and product mix. This analysis provides deeper insights than traditional business reports, which typically compare revenue and KPIs across time periods without exploring the underlying drivers.  \n\n**Key Concepts:**  \n1. **Price:** Reflects the selling price of products. Higher prices improve margins but may reduce sales volume.  \n2. **Volume:** Represents the number of products sold. Increased volume boosts revenue but may not significantly impact profit margins.  \n3. **Mix:** Examines the composition of products sold. Selling more high-margin products positively impacts revenue, while a shift toward low-margin products can drag it down.  \n\n**Advanced Analysis with Zebra BI:**  \nZebra BI for Office simplifies PVM analysis, enabling users to create actionable reports with a single click. It visualizes how price, volume, and mix contribute to revenue changes, making it easier to identify trends and opportunities. The tool is ideal for BI specialists, FP&A professionals, consultants, and managers.  \n\n**Enhanced Reporting:**  \nPVM analysis can be extended by incorporating additional dimensions, such as new and discontinued products, to provide a comprehensive view of revenue drivers. For example, new products may offset revenue losses from discontinued ones.  \n\n**Excel Implementation:**  \nTo perform PVM analysis in Excel, you need product-level data, including revenue and quantities for the current and previous periods. Two methods are commonly used:  \n1. **Mix Change Method:** Calculates mix variance based on changes in product share.  \n2. **Controller Akademie Method:** Treats mix variance as a residual after accounting for price, volume, new, and discontinued products.  \n\n**Visualization:**  \nUsing Zebra BI, businesses can create detailed charts and small multiples to analyze variances across product groups. This visualization highlights the impact of price, volume, and mix on revenue, enabling data-driven decision-making.  \n\nPVM analysis is an essential tool for improving business reporting, offering actionable insights to drive growth and profitability.",

The process begins by defining objectives, such as increasing profitability, improving category performance, or reducing operational costs. Clear targets, like cutting low-performing SKUs by 20%, guide the analysis.  \n\nNext, sales and profitability data for each SKU are collected, including revenue, units sold, and profit margins. High-performing SKUs are identified using metrics like the Pareto principle, which highlights the top 20% of SKUs driving 80% of revenue. Underperforming SKUs are flagged for potential removal. Inventory and supply chain costs are also assessed, focusing on metrics like cost to serve and inventory turnover to identify SKUs with disproportionate operational costs.  \n\nConsumer demand analysis examines purchasing patterns to pinpoint SKUs with low appeal or redundancy. Retailer-specific performance is reviewed to ensure alignment with partner preferences, while promotional impact is analyzed to identify SKUs overly reliant on discounts. Benchmarking against competitors helps identify gaps and opportunities in the product mix.  \n\nFinally, redundant or low-performing SKUs are consolidated or removed, and a rationalization plan is developed. This plan aligns with broader business objectives, such as profitability and supply chain efficiency, and is communicated effectively to stakeholders. By following these steps, businesses can streamline their product portfolios, enhance operational efficiency, and better meet consumer and market demands.",
