Leaders agree that climate change poses one of the greatest threats to our planet, and that we should reshape our societies to be climate resilient. The ‘E’ includes physical risks such as biodiversity loss and the increased risk of flood and extreme weather events. When looking at ‘E’, investors also face so-called transition risks, i.e. risks linked to the transition to a low-carbon economy. An example of transition risk is the shift to new technologies. Technological breakthroughs might decrease the price of renewable energy, leading in turn to a steep drop in the demand for fossil fuels and a radical change in the energy mix. Businesses or countries that mine, process, or sell fossil fuels may need to write down assets or ultimately default. Banks, insurers and pension funds that have outstanding loans or corporate stocks in the fossil fuel industries will see the value of their investments decrease in the long term. The speed, scale and success rate of adopting climate-resilient solutions, as well as investor preparedness, will determine the actual impacts on the financial services industry.\n\nBut the business case for embracing integration of ‘E factors’ in investment decisions is not only about risk management. The move towards more sustainable business models translates to concrete opportunities for companies to become more innovative and reduce the now high costs of production and waste management. A clear example is set by the shift from linear to circular models in the way companies make use of plastics. Only nine per cent of total plastic used for packaging is actually recycled – while a third is left in fragile ecosystems, and forty per cent ends up in landfills. Discarded plastic is obviously harmful for the environment, but it also harms the balance sheets of companies. According to the World Economic Forum, plastic packaging waste represents an 80–120 billion US dollar loss to the global economy every year. This is what encouraged Unilever and others to embark on a journey from linear to circular, where plastic packaging can be reused, recycled or composted.",

A study by McKinsey and NielsenIQ analyzed five years of US sales data, tracking 600,000 products across 32 categories, to understand the impact of ESG-related claims on consumer purchasing behavior. The findings reveal that products with ESG-related claims experienced 28% cumulative growth over five years, compared to 20% for products without such claims, accounting for 56% of all growth in the categories studied.\n\nKey insights include the broad appeal of ESG claims across demographics, with higher-income households, urban residents, and families with children showing stronger engagement. Both large and small brands benefited from ESG claims, with private-label products also gaining traction. Less-common claims, such as \"vegan\" or \"carbon zero,\" were associated with higher growth, while products with multiple ESG claims outperformed those with single claims, suggesting consumers perceive greater authenticity in multifaceted efforts.\n\nDespite these promising trends, the study highlights limitations, such as the inability to establish causality between ESG claims and sales growth or verify the accuracy of claims. Greenwashing remains a significant risk, potentially undermining consumer trust and regulatory efforts.\n\nFor CPG companies, the research underscores the importance of aligning ESG claims with meaningful actions, designing cost-effective sustainable products, and leveraging both established and new products to drive growth. By addressing category-specific dynamics and embracing holistic ESG strategies, companies can achieve both financial success and positive environmental and social impact, demonstrating that ESG and growth are not mutually exclusive.",

ESG encompasses environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and corporate governance, with companies expected to reduce emissions, foster ethical practices, and ensure transparency.  \n\nOrganisations prioritising ESG benefit from stronger reputations, risk mitigation, investment appeal, and talent recruitment, particularly among younger employees who value sustainability. Conversely, firms neglecting ESG face financial penalties, consumer boycotts, and loss of market share to competitors with better ESG performance. Political affiliation, education, and generational differences significantly influence consumer engagement with ESG issues, with progressive and educated individuals showing higher concern.  \n\nTo address these challenges, companies must acknowledge ESG shortcomings, improve practices, and engage consumers through education and transparency. By investing in sustainable technologies, enhancing labour conditions, and fostering trust, organisations can align with consumer expectations and secure long-term profitability.

ESG initiatives focus on three pillars: environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and governance practices. These programs aim to reduce environmental impact, promote fair treatment of employees and communities, and ensure ethical business operations. While ESG has roots in socially responsible investing from the 1960s, its formalization began in 2004-2006, spearheaded by the United Nations.  \n\nDespite widespread adoption—over 90% of S&P 500 companies publish sustainability reports—many ESG efforts remain underdeveloped. A 2024 Deloitte survey revealed only 25% of executives reported significant progress on sustainability goals, with challenges including data collection complexity, reporting accuracy, and resource constraints.  \n\nESG initiatives offer tangible benefits, such as competitive advantages, improved financial performance, customer loyalty, and adaptability to regulatory changes. For example, ESG-focused companies attract investors, with $8.4 trillion in U.S. assets managed using ESG criteria in 2022. Additionally, ESG programs can reduce costs, enhance brand reputation, and improve employee engagement.  \n\nDeveloping an ESG strategy involves stakeholder input, materiality assessments, measurable goals, and robust reporting frameworks. Common frameworks include IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, GRI Standards, and CDP. Companies must also address challenges like greenwashing, employee training, and resource allocation.  \n\nTechnology plays a vital role in ESG management, with software tools enabling data collection, reporting, and carbon accounting. Vendors like IBM and Microsoft offer solutions to track metrics, conduct audits, and manage compliance. As ESG regulations expand globally, such as the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, businesses must prioritize effective strategies to ensure long-term success and accountability.",

                "description": "How Singapore compares with other nations\n\nBased on information from the United Nations, 130 countries have now set or are considering a target of reducing emissions to net zero by 2050. The adoption of carbon pricing as a key economic lever to reduce emissions is expected to be a global norm in time.\n\nAs for the right price of carbon to allow countries to achieve enough reduction to keep the global increase in temperature below 2 degrees Celsius, the International Monetary Fund recommends a 2030 carbon price floor of US$75 for advanced economies, about US$50 for high-income emerging markets such as China and US$25 for lower-income emerging markets such as India. The announced increase in Singapore’s carbon tax is therefore in the right direction.\n\nRiding on the back of the passage of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the trading of carbon credits on a global scale is set to grow and will likely drive a steady growth in carbon markets. Hence, the announcement that companies will be given the option to use high-quality international carbon credits to offset up to 5% of taxable emissions in 2024 is a leading one, putting Singapore among jurisdictions that have implemented similar mechanisms, such as Japan and the European Union. Indeed, this announcement is a strategic and welcomed move — one that will position Singapore well to become a carbon services and trading hub.\n\nBut will the use of carbon offsets help companies manage the cost of carbon tax?\n\nThe price of carbon offsets is a function of multiple factors — mainly project types and the country of origin — and is expected to increase given demands from the private sector to become net zero or carbon-neutral. Given the range of projects available in the market, some more credible than others, the specific mention of high-quality carbon credits such as offsets from nature-based climate solutions is noteworthy. The Singapore Government has yet to provide details on what would qualify as high-quality carbon offsets. However, this option can potentially cushion the impact of the hike in carbon tax if companies can successfully invest in such qualifying carbon credits or secure them in advance and at prices below the increased carbon tax.",

                "description": "Singapore’s carbon tax is a key measure in its strategy to transition to a low-carbon economy and achieve net-zero emissions. Introduced in 2019 as Southeast Asia’s first carbon pricing scheme, the tax initially set at S$5/tCO₂e will progressively increase to S$25/tCO₂e in 2024, S$45/tCO₂e by 2026-2027, and S$50-80/tCO₂e by 2030. Covering approximately 70% of emissions from 50 facilities in sectors like manufacturing, power, waste, and water, it is one of the most comprehensive globally.  \n\nThe tax incentivizes businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint, invest in low-carbon solutions, and align with national climate goals. Revenue generated will fund decarbonization efforts and cushion the impact on businesses and households. To mitigate risks for emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) sectors, a transition framework provides temporary allowances based on efficiency benchmarks and decarbonization plans, minimizing carbon leakage and supporting competitiveness.  \n\nFrom 2024, companies can offset up to 5% of taxable emissions using high-quality international carbon credits, fostering demand for regulated carbon markets while prioritizing domestic reductions. The government also ensures fair electricity pricing to prevent excessive cost pass-through to consumers. For households, measures like U-Save rebates will help manage rising utility costs, with the average 4-room HDB flat seeing an estimated $4 monthly increase in bills due to the tax hike.  \n\nSingapore’s carbon tax aligns with global practices, with similar frameworks in jurisdictions like the EU, South Korea, and California. By progressively raising the tax and implementing supportive measures, Singapore aims to balance economic competitiveness with its climate ambitions, driving the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future.",

                "description": "Singapore’s carbon tax applies to industrial facilities emitting at least 25,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent annually. Initially set at $5 per tonne (2019–2023), the tax will increase to $25 per tonne (2024–2025), $45 per tonne (2026–2027), and $50–$80 per tonne by 2030. Revenue from the tax supports decarbonisation, green economy transitions, and mitigates impacts on businesses and households.  \n\nStarting January 2024, facilities can offset up to 5% of taxable emissions using high-quality International Carbon Credits (ICC). Singapore has signed agreements with countries like Bhutan, Chile, and Peru under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to operationalise ICC partnerships. Facilities unable to fully utilise their ICC offset limit in 2024 can roll over unused credits to 2025. For example, a facility emitting 100 kilotonnes of CO₂ annually can roll over unused ICC offsets (up to 4 kilotonnes) from 2024 to 2025.  \n\nAdditionally, Singapore has signed MOUs with over 15 countries to expand ICC availability, requiring active private sector participation. The government continues to support these efforts as more agreements are signed.  \n\nTo prevent carbon leakage and support emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) companies, a transition framework will be introduced in 2024. This framework, managed by the Economic Development Board (EDB), will provide allowances based on efficiency standards and decarbonisation targets, giving companies time to adapt to a low-carbon economy.",

The nation has set ambitious goals, including peaking carbon emissions before 2030, quadrupling solar energy deployment by 2025, and achieving 2 GWp of solar energy by 2030. Its “80-80-80 in 2030” plan aims to green 80% of buildings, ensure 80% of new developments are super low energy, and improve energy efficiency by 80% for top-tier buildings. Additionally, all vehicles will transition to cleaner energy by 2040, and 20% of schools will be carbon neutral by 2030.  \n\nSingapore is the first Southeast Asian country to implement a carbon tax, starting at S$5/tCO2e in 2019 and rising to S$25/tCO2e in 2024, with further increases to S$50-80/tCO2e by 2030. While there is no cap-and-trade system, companies can voluntarily trade carbon credits to offset up to 5% of taxable emissions. Businesses emitting over 25,000 tCO2e annually are taxed, and rising electricity tariffs will indirectly affect others.  \n\nMandatory climate disclosure regulations enhance transparency and accountability. All Singapore Exchange (SGX)-listed companies must submit annual sustainability reports, including Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) compliance. From 2024, high-risk sectors must adhere to these standards, with broader adoption by 2025. The Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee (SRAC) is guiding companies toward International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) compliance.  \n\nTerrascope, a decarbonization platform, aids businesses in measuring and managing carbon emissions across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 using AI and machine learning.

While Gen Z shares many food preferences with Millennials, such as expectations for high-quality and sustainable products, this new demographic cohort has significantly divergent tastes from generations past.\n\nTo keep higher education leaders up to speed on evolving tastes, this article unpacks the food industry trends that inform Gen Z tastes. Read on to learn four food preferences common among Gen Z—and how food providers are evolving to meet them.\n\nPreference 1: It’s all about the veggies\n\nIt takes little cajoling to get Gen Z to eat their greens. The number of Gen Z students who are vegetarian or vegan already is approaching the percentage seen among Millennials (12%) and is expected to rise over the next ten years. While many cite improved health as a factor in foregoing meat, a growing number indicate ethical concerns as their top reason for embracing plant-based diets. Even non-vegetarians from Gen Z expect vegetarian options for every meal, and are more likely to prefer dishes where the entree is veggie-forward or veggie-centric than in the past. Food producers are therefore experimenting with new ways of crafting and marketing meals with fruits and vegetables at their core, such as the recently viral Impossible Burger.",

Prioritizing experiences over sustenance, they favor adventurous, health-conscious, and socially responsible choices. Millennials dine out more frequently than previous generations, with 53% eating out weekly compared to 43% of the general population. Factors driving this trend include busy lifestyles, urban living, social engagement, and a preference for affordable luxuries over material goods.  \n\nThis shift has led to significant changes in the industry. Fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle and Sweetgreen have flourished, offering quick, quality meals that balance convenience and affordability. The rise of food delivery services, driven by millennials’ demand, has transformed dining logistics, with apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash becoming essential.

Demand for these goods is shaped by various economic factors, including employment, wages, inflation, interest rates, and consumer confidence.  \n\nStaples like food tend to have stable demand, while discretionary items such as cars and electronics are more sensitive to economic conditions. High employment and rising wages boost consumer spending, whereas stagnant wages or high unemployment reduce demand. Inflation erodes purchasing power, making goods less affordable, while high interest rates deter credit-based purchases of expensive items like automobiles.  \n\nConsumer confidence plays a crucial role; when people feel optimistic about their financial future and the economy, they are more likely to spend, especially on major purchases. Conversely, economic downturns or high interest rates can suppress demand for cyclical goods like cars and jewelry, while noncyclical goods like food and medicine remain consistently needed.  \n\nThe \"invisible hand\" of the market, a concept popularized by Adam Smith, describes how individual self-interest and voluntary exchanges lead to societal benefits. Consumers indirectly guide producers by expressing preferences through their purchasing decisions, driving competition and innovation. This process raises living standards by making goods cheaper and more accessible over time.  \n\nIn summary, the demand for consumer goods is closely tied to the health of the economy. A strong economy with high employment, rising wages, low inflation, and favorable interest rates fosters increased spending, while economic challenges dampen demand, particularly for discretionary items.",

Blends of digital and physical, delivery and in-store, niche offerings, and high volume can be configured around local maximums for consumers who prioritize quality, value, choice, and convenience differently. Some may, but not every store will likely look futuristic. However, even the lowest income consumer still wants it all, relative to their circumstances, and could be better served by their grocer as an individual.\n\n\n\nResponsibility as a requisite\n\nClimate change is a reality with which grocery should contend. It is not just a matter of setting goals and dealing with crop loss and disruptions. As the effects of climate change become more pronounced and sustainability becomes a more central purchase driver, it also means creating authentic progress and defendable claims. Climate responsibility continues to shift from a largely siloed public relations and regulatory compliance-driven function to a constituent-, shareholder-, and employee-driven imperative that should be incorporated into end-to-end business decision-making.\n\nHowever, we could argue that the implication for grocers’ markets is more generalizable. Consumers consider a larger set of issues as they ask the companies they do business with to be active contributors in supporting their values and identities. Your employees and investors likely feel the same way and may see silence and inaction on issues as its own form of statement, meaning companies won’t have the option of staying quietly on the sidelines. No matter how quiet or loud an approach you take for communication, the implication is that companies should also understand and be true to their values and sense of purpose in a manner that is holistically incorporated into all functions.\n\nAvoiding backlash and lost sales is one side of the implication. But if consumers believe you are looking out for them and share their values, it can open new opportunities, including competing on aspects other than price. There is the much-discussed “sustainability premium,” but consider personalized health and wellness, including food as medicine.\n\nThree in four consumers are actively seeking more personalized nutrition, up 13 percentage points year over year.29 Moreover, 55% of consumers say they are willing to pay a premium for the right foods because they contribute to their health and wellness.

What we see is the emergence of an aspirational consumer who is focused on value-driven choices. Worldwide, consumers tell us they are inclined to purchase food that aligns with their attitudes towards health, convenience and sustainability. However, escalating food prices and cost-of-living challenges are constraining their ability to fulfil these aspirations—a sentiment echoed across the 28 global markets surveyed. In North America, for example, nearly half of respondents (43%) find food prices prohibitively high, and concerns over food safety and product quality curb consumer confidence.\n\nAs consumers sharpen their focus on the origin and functionality of their food, our analysis finds that food businesses have an important role to play in serving informed and aspirational choices—and that role is shifting. What’s more, the disruption of traditional value chains is creating new opportunities for both incumbents and new entrants, and for players, such as healthcare providers and technology companies, who may not have seen themselves as part of the traditional food business. We see areas of convergence between health and wellness, convenience and technology, on the one hand, and food on the other. These dynamics are illustrated in some of our key findings:\n\nConcerns over ultra-processed foods and pesticide use are intensifying among approximately 60% of consumers surveyed.\n\nAmong the 5% of respondents using GLP-1 weight-loss pharmaceuticals, a majority report reducing food spending and eating smaller portion sizes.\n\nOver the past year, nearly 40% of respondents have explored non-traditional food retail spaces such as on-demand grocery and subscription services.\n\n70% of consumers now use healthcare apps or wearable technologies; a niche group of ‘health-tech enthusiasts’ (9% of our sample) report making significant lifestyle changes resulting from their use.",

Research shows that 50% of consumers find packaged fresh food appealing for its convenience, citing benefits like contamination prevention, extended shelf life, and clear labeling. Packaging also offers operational advantages for grocers, such as inventory management and reduced food waste.  \n\nDespite its benefits, increased packaging raises sustainability concerns. Food waste is a major issue, with fresh fruits and vegetables being the most wasted items. Packaging can mitigate this by extending shelf life and reducing spoilage, potentially lowering methane emissions from decomposing food in landfills. Consumers also value packaging for its role in reducing at-home food waste, a top strategy for saving money. However, grocers often underestimate consumer interest in cutting food waste, with 73% of consumers prioritizing it compared to 48% of grocery executives.  \n\nTo balance convenience and sustainability, grocers can adopt innovative packaging solutions, invest in recycling programs, and explore removing “best buy” dates where unnecessary. Advances in materials science and AI may further enhance packaging’s role in reducing waste and improving food freshness. Additionally, grocers face growing competition from internet-only retailers, delivery apps, and meal-kit providers, which cater to convenience-seeking consumers. By addressing packaging concerns and leveraging technology, grocers can better meet consumer demands for fresh, convenient, and sustainable food options.",
