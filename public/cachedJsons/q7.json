Originally launched as WOTU in 2015 and acquired by Zomato in 2018, Hyperpure is a B2B platform providing kitchen supplies to over 40,000 customers in the HoReCa (Hotels, Restaurants, and Caterers) industry. It operates on low margins but achieves high volumes, offering restaurants a streamlined supply chain solution.  \n\nHyperpure's integration with Blinkit, Zomato's quick commerce arm, has further accelerated its growth. By supplying farm-fresh produce directly to Blinkit's dark stores, Hyperpure supports Blinkit's promise of 10-minute deliveries while cutting out middlemen and reducing costs. This synergy has led to a 4X revenue increase for Hyperpure since Blinkit's acquisition in 2022. Zomato plans to expand Blinkit's operations to over 2,000 dark stores across India by 2026, leveraging Hyperpure's infrastructure and capabilities.  \n\nDespite its success, Hyperpure's revenue remains small compared to global peers like Sysco Corp and US Foods, primarily due to India's smaller restaurant industry and reliance on unorganized supply chains. However, changing eating habits and a shift toward organized sourcing are expected to drive significant growth in India's food services market, projected to double by 2030.  \n\nHyperpure's focus on supply chain efficiency mirrors the strategies of Indian retail giants DMart and Trent, which have achieved profitability through streamlined operations. As Blinkit scales rapidly, Hyperpure's \"farm-to-fork\" model positions it as a strategic asset for Zomato, supporting both restaurant and quick commerce growth. This synergy is set to strengthen Zomato's competitive edge in India's evolving retail and food service landscape.",

Despite the growth and the undeniable value it has brought to our lives in the form of convenience to access each and every dish or grocery product within our reach , most firms nationally and internationally struggle to make profits from their core business. This is because they need to cater to three stakeholders - Customer / Restaurant owners / Delivery partners ....while customer brings in pricing pressure.... restaurant owners / delivery agents are the biggest cost drivers ....there is thus a pull and push on both sides of the profit and loss account. As most customers practise 'multi-homing'.. the decision to place an order is in most cases only after comparing the price of the same dish in the competing food delivery app...even the incumbents and dominant players thus need to be extremely competative on a daily basis . Going forward , given the scale of the industry and the work force it commands.. regulatory requirements are likely to evolve governing the mechanics for both restaurant commissions and delivery partner remuneration.. both of which are likely to drive costs .... which could mean that the minimum order value for offering free deliveries are likely to rise to ensure sustainable profitability to the business owners ....this could impact the extremely value oriented Indian consumer....affecting scale...which in turn affects profitability. The challenge therefore could be to build strong and sustainable forms of alternate revenues (to provide value pricing to the customer) made possible by the scale of operations. The evolving trends are advertising , B2B sales wherein food delivery app owners directly source groceries at lower costs and then pass it over to business entities/ restaurants earning small margins at scale , ride hailing to leverage the logistic infrastructure,expanding into high margin product portfolio, cloud kitchen , data analytic services ...etc. I sincerely hope these institutions are able to survive and earn reasonable profits.. for all said in respect of the value that has been created- convenience to the customer / expanding market to the restaurant operator / employment to the delivery partner ...(including opportunity for part employment) ...world over ..these institutions haven't made much profits and in most cases only loss....even at the scale at which they are operating today!",

                "description": "Founded in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah, Zomato began as FoodieBay, a restaurant listing platform, later rebranded to avoid confusion with eBay. Initially focused on menus and reviews, Zomato expanded into food delivery in 2015, achieving unicorn status by 2018 and going public in 2021 with an $8 billion valuation. Today, Zomato offers food delivery, restaurant discovery, dining-out services, and quick commerce through Blinkit, which provides ultra-fast delivery of groceries and essentials.  \n\nZomato’s competitive edge lies in reliability, service quality, and its extensive network of 276,000 restaurant partners. Its average delivery time of 12.5 minutes and fulfillment accuracy of over 99% redefine customer expectations. The company’s focus on Northern Indian metros, particularly Delhi NCR, ensures dominance in key markets.  \n\nIndia’s food services market, valued at ₹5.5 lakh crores, is growing at an 18% CAGR in online food delivery, with Zomato holding a 55% market share. Quick commerce, valued at $2.8 billion, is also expanding rapidly, driven by urbanization and disposable incomes. Zomato’s acquisition of Blinkit positions it as a leader in this space, with a 45% market share.  \n\nZomato’s revenue model includes delivery fees, restaurant commissions, and advertising. Hyperpure, its B2B supply chain, supports restaurants with high-quality ingredients. Zomato’s customer segmentation focuses on aspirers and Ikigai profiles, leveraging their willingness to pay and high order frequency.  \n\nTo enhance engagement, Zomato plans initiatives like Zomato Social for peer recommendations and gamified loyalty programs like Zomato X. Resurrection campaigns target churned users with personalized offers. Zomato’s marketing strategy combines meme-driven content, regional ads, and partnerships with platforms like Instagram and IRCTC.  \n\nWith a focus on retention, monetization, and operational efficiency, Zomato continues to innovate and solidify its position as a market leader in India’s food delivery and quick commerce sectors.",

                "description": "Hyperpure, a subsidiary of Zomato, has emerged as a critical player in the company’s ecosystem, contributing 27% of Zomato’s total revenue and surpassing ₹5,000 Cr in annualized revenue. Originally launched as WOTU in 2015 and acquired by Zomato in 2018, Hyperpure is a B2B platform providing kitchen supplies to over 40,000 customers in the HoReCa (Hotels, Restaurants, and Caterers) industry. It operates on low margins but achieves high volumes, offering restaurants a streamlined supply chain solution.  \n\nHyperpure’s integration with Blinkit, Zomato’s quick commerce arm acquired in 2022, has further accelerated its growth. By supplying farm-fresh produce directly to Blinkit’s dark stores, Hyperpure supports Blinkit’s promise of 10-minute deliveries while cutting out middlemen and reducing costs. This synergy has led to a 4X revenue increase for Hyperpure since Blinkit’s acquisition, with plans to expand Blinkit’s dark stores to over 2,000 locations by 2026.  \n\nDespite its success, Hyperpure’s revenue remains small compared to global peers like Sysco Corp and US Foods, primarily due to India’s smaller restaurant industry and reliance on unorganized supply chains. However, changing consumer habits and a shift toward organized sourcing are expected to drive significant growth in India’s food services market, projected to double by 2030.  \n\nHyperpure’s efficient supply chain management is a potential moat for Zomato, enabling Blinkit to compete in the hyper-competitive quick commerce space. Investments in warehousing and direct farmer sourcing further strengthen this advantage. As Hyperpure continues to scale, it is poised to play a pivotal role in Zomato’s long-term strategy, supporting both restaurant partnerships and quick commerce expansion.",
